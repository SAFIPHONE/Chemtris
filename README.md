##Objective

The objective of this game is to teach basic concepts of Chemistry, primarily Organic Chemistry. It is a elegant combination of the popular game TETRIS and Chemistry. The first few levels teaches users how to fit 3D models together through various 3D models. Then there is two levels that targets the Chemistry aspect of the game by making users make a specific compound such as *H2O*. All the models in each level shake to resemble unstable elements, until either the row is cleared or the compound is made.
